# Alzheimer's Disease Computer Extension
Forked from [Daily Typer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/daily-typer/pkafjlgablpiocffekncinpmfojicfgi) project.

Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) is typically symptomized by degrading cognitive health. Given the absence of a cure, early treatment is emphasized. The question becomes: how can early detection of AD be optimized?

The hope of this project is to provide a convenient at-home screening tool that continuously monitors cognitive health by tracking character per minute, CPM, and pauses per minute, PPM. Both computer usage variables have been found to be good indicators of cognitive impairment based on [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6033108/).
